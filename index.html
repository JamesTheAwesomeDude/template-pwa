<title>Example Web App (Web Version)</title>

<link rel="manifest" href="mywebapp.webmanifest">

<h1>This page has a DARK blue titlebar because you haven't installed it.</h1>
<!--
<script src="init-sw.js"></script>
<p>Nevertheless, we are running a service worker.</p>
-->
<p>Press the 「&nbsp;&#x22ee;&nbsp;」 button, then click “Add to Home screen” (Chrome) <em>or “Install” (Firefox)</em> to install a copy of it.</p>
<p>This is an example of a "Web App", which provides an app-like UX while allowing developers to use the web browser as a development platform and dodge Apple's expensive, proprietary SDK and Android's cumbersome, proprietary SDK, while writing one app that runs on all platforms.</p>
